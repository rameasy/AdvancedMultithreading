Executor framework is an abstraction to manage multiple threads by ourselves.
It decouples from the actual task from its the execution of the task. 

As part this framework there are two main interfaces
1. Executor
	It contains execute() method through which we can execute only Runnables. 
	This execute method returns void, therefore the is no return type

2. ExecutorService  
	It contains submit() method which can handle both Runnables & Callables. This method returns Future object. 
	It extends Executor interface therefore has execute method.	
	
Executors.java
	Its a utitlity class which contains may factory methods to create different types of ExecutorService objects.
	1. SingleThreadExecutor
	2. FixedThreadPoolExecutor
	3. CachedThreadPoolExecutor
	4. ScheduledExecutor
